# Simple Interest Calculator
This project provides a bash script to calculate simple interest based on user input.

## How it works:
The script takes three inputs:
1. **Principal Amount**: The initial sum of money.
2. **Annual Interest Rate**: The percentage of interest per year.
3. **Time Period**: The duration in years.

## Formula:
The calculation is based on the following formula:
`Simple Interest = (Principal * Time * Rate) / 100`

## Usage:
Run the script using the following command:
`bash simple-interest.sh`
